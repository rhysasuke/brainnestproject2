        <h1>How It All Started</h1>
       
        <p>Being a young father, bored at home with a baby having played what must have been the 10000th game of Fifa in a row I was browsing the web when I saw a small course on HTML Canvas Development, I started it, within  ten minutes I was submerged in it, <br>I liked how powerful it made you feel to be able to create such things with a few lines of text and so I started taking some courses out in order to be able to become better at it. It took many hours of hard work, many times during the night while the baby and her mother were
             sleeping and it was definitely worth it. I started getting noticed, and built a couple of webpages for a couple of local companies in Malta.
            I still have a long way to go however I am very happy with my progress so far and look forward to always keep to improve. Even though this may not be viewed as the most exciting of all hobbies I think it is a good way to relax and learn how you can create powerful websites to make most of what you want come alive
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            My Dream is to some day manage to build an online business on my own and be able to manage it and run it myself, Of course this is a long way to go but I am confident that with enough discipline, hardwork, attention to detail and gravity this will be nothing but achievable.
